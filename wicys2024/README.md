# 2024 WiCyS Target CTF

This folder contains writeups of most of the trickier problems that were presented during the 2024 Target CTF.

The problems were presented in sequential order that created a story as you moved through them.

There were two categories of challenges: offensive (O) and defensive (D). Each problem is named accordingly. For example, O1 means Offensive 1, or the first offensive challenge.

Most of these challenges should be workable with the images and information I've reproduced here, barring the ones that require active interaction with a web server.
