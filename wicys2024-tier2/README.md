# 2024 WiCyS Target CTF

This folder contains writeups of al the problems that were presented during Tier 2 of the 2024 Target CTF. These challenges were significantly more challenging than their Tier 1 counterparts, so I thought a detailed writeup for each would be nice.

There are two categories of challenges: offensive (O) and defensive (D). Each problem is named accordingly. For example, O1 means Offensive 1, or the first offensive challenge.

Most of these challenges should be workable with the images and information I've reproduced here, barring the ones that require active interaction with a web server.
